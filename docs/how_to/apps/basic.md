# Install releases

You can run helmsman with the [example.toml](https://github.com/Praqma/helmsman/blob/master/example.toml) or [example.yaml](https://github.com/Praqma/helmsman/blob/master/example.yaml) file.

```shell

$ helmsman --apply -f example.toml

# Delete releases

You can then change your desire, for example to disable the Jenkins release that was created above by setting `enabled = false` :

Then run Helmsman again and it will detect that you want to delete Jenkins:

> Note: As of v1.4.0-rc, deleting the jenkins app entry in the desired state file WILL result in deleting the jenkins release. To prevent this, use the `--keep-untracked-releases` flag with your Helmsman command.

# Rollback releases

> Rollbacks in helm versions 2.8.2 and higher may not work due to a [bug](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/3722).
Similarly, if you change `enabled` back to `true`, it will figure out that you would like to roll it back.

# Upgrade releases

Every time you run Helmsman, (unless the release is [protected or deployed in a protected namespace](../misc/protect_namespaces_and_releases.md)) it will check if upgrade is necessary (using the helm-diff plugin) and only upgrade if there are changes.

If you change the chart, the existing release will be deleted and a new one with the same name will be created using the new chart.
