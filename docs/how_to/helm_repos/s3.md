# Using private helm repos in S3

Helmsman allows you to use private charts from private repos. Currently only repos hosted in S3 or GCS buckets are supported for private repos.

You need to provide one of the following env variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`

Helmsman uses the [helm s3](https://github.com/hypnoglow/helm-s3) plugin to work with S3 helm repos.

```toml

[helmRepos]
myPrivateRepo = "s3://this-is-a-private-repo/charts"

```

```yaml

helmRepos:
  myPrivateRepo: "s3://this-is-a-private-repo/charts"

```
